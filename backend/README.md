# backend - RentACar (Milestone 1)

This folder contains the skeleton for the backend. For Milestone 1 we only need the project structure:

- api.php - entry point (placeholder)
- routes/ - place to keep route definitions (placeholder_routes.php)
- services/ - business logic layer (empty for now)
- dao/ - data access objects (empty for now)

Do not implement DB access or authentication here until Milestone 2+. When proceeding:
- Install FlightPHP with Composer and bootstrap api.php
- Implement DAO classes (PDO) under /dao
- Implement services under /services
- Add actual routes under /routes
